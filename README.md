# clapper-appimage
Test of Clapper AppImage, not intended for daily-driving yet.

## Known issues / TO-DO

- Build `clapper` from source instead of relying on Arch repos
- Integrate self-updater
- Playing videos doesn't work at all at the moment due to not including codecs
- Need to refactor it to use newer template & to not bundle `mesa`
